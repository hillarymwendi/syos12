               am a computer technology student at JKUAT in my third year. 
               I love programing bt am fascinated by Web programing.
               I would like to teach guys who want to be good in programing.
               Many guys think and vote for Python as the best language in programing,
               bt i have one thing against these guys... they nwant to discard other languages
               I would like to place a challenge possed to me...
               <font color="red" size="14">there are 100 Languges so far... can you use 10 various languages
               to produce the same program?</font>
               well think about it.. i like using python for system security... 
               if you wish to contact me you can contact me on the above email or text me on whatsapp
               at +254717091187.. wish to get your feedback on this site.
